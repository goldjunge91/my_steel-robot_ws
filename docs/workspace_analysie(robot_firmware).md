# robot_firmware Directory Analysis

## Function

The `robot_firmware` directory is intended to house the low-level software that runs directly on the robot's embedded microcontroller(s). This firmware would be responsible for direct actuator control (motors, servos, ESCs), sensor data acquisition (encoders, IMUs), and handling communication with a higher-level ROS 2 controller (e.g., a Raspberry Pi) via various protocols (serial, I2C, SPI). It would also implement essential low-level safety mechanisms.

## Purpose

The purpose of this firmware would be to:

*   **Bridge Hardware and Software:** Provide the necessary interface between the physical hardware components and the ROS 2 control software running on a companion computer.
*   **Real-time Control:** Execute time-critical control loops and sensor data acquisition that cannot be reliably handled by a non-real-time operating system like Linux (where ROS 2 typically runs).
*   **Resource Optimization:** Run efficiently on resource-constrained microcontrollers, optimizing for memory, processing power, and power consumption.

## Usage

If this directory were to contain actual firmware, its usage would involve:

1.  **Development:** Writing and compiling C/C++ code (or other embedded languages) for the target microcontroller.
2.  **Flashing:** Uploading the compiled firmware binary to the microcontroller.
3.  **Integration:** A ROS 2 hardware interface package (e.g., `mecabridge_hardware` or a similar custom package) would communicate with this firmware over a specified protocol to send commands and receive state information.

**Note:** At the time of analysis, the `src/robot_firmware` directory appears to be empty, with its contents potentially being git-ignored or located elsewhere. This analysis is based on the inferred role of a directory with this name in a ROS 2 robot project context.
