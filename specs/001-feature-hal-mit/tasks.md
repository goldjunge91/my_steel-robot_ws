Parallel execution guidance:
- Run contract tests (T003, T004, T007) in parallel once basic package scaffolding and hw-interface stubs exist.
- Implement T005 (models) and T006 (hw interface) in parallel when different authors work on headers vs implementation.

Agent commands (examples an LLM can execute):
- "Create ament_cmake package skeleton at /workspaces/my_steel-robot_ws/src/mecabridge_hardware with package.xml and CMakeLists.txt."
- "Add class mecabridge_hardware::MecabridgeHWInterface with pluginlib export and implement configure/start/stop/read/write stubs."
- "Add failing pytest at specs/.../contracts/tests/test_switch_mode.py asserting service schema."
