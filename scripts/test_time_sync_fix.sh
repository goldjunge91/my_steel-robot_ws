echo "1. Flash the new firmware to your Pico:"
echo "   - Put Pico in bootloader mode (hold BOOTSEL while connecting USB)"

echo ""
echo "2. Monitor the serial output:"
echo "   - Connect to /dev/ttyACM0 at 115200 baud"
echo "   - Look for these improved messages:"
echo "     • 'TIME SYNC successful' (good)"
echo "     • 'TIME SYNC error (agent not ready) – continuing without sync' (acceptable)"
echo "     • 'TIME SYNC timeout (agent busy) – continuing without sync' (acceptable)"

echo "   - No more 'ERROR Time synk failed (ret=1)' followed by 'Entities Destroyed'"

echo "   - Entities should stay created even if time sync fails"
echo "   - Publishers should work normally"
