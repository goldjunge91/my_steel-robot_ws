# Docker Compose Test Results

## Test Environment
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Platform**: macOS (darwin)
- **Docker Image**: mysteel/robot:humble-arm64
- **Image Size**: 1.99GB
- **Test Configuration**: docker/compose.robot-pi.test.yaml

## Test Execution Summary

### Prerequisites Setup
✅ Created required directories:
- `/var/log/robot` - Log storage
- `/etc/robot` - Configuration storage
- `/var/lib/tailscale` - Tailscale state storage

✅ Set proper permissions on directories

✅ Created test environment file (`.env.test`)

### Container Deployment

#### Test Configuration
Since this test was performed on a development machine (macOS) without physical hardware devices (`/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/video0`), a test-specific compose file was created that:
- Removes hardware device dependencies
- Keeps containers alive for testing
- Verifies ROS2 environment and package availability
- Uses simplified health checks

#### Deployment Command
```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.robot-pi.test.yaml --env-file docker/.env.test up -d
```

## Test Results

### 1. Container Startup ✅
Both containers started successfully:
- `microros-agent-test` - Started and became healthy
- `robot-bringup-test` - Started and became healthy (depends on microros-agent)

### 2. Health Check Verification ✅

#### microros-agent Health Check
- **Status**: healthy
- **Check**: ROS2 topic list command executes successfully
- **Interval**: 10s
- **Retries**: 3
- **Start Period**: 30s

#### robot-bringup Health Check
- **Status**: healthy
- **Check**: ROS2 packages available (robot_controller found)
- **Interval**: 15s
- **Retries**: 5
- **Start Period**: 60s

### 3. ROS2 Environment Verification ✅

#### Available Robot Packages
```
robot_controller
robot_description
robot_hardware_interfaces
robot_localization
robot_localization_tool
robot_state_publisher
robot_utils
```

#### ROS2 Topics
```
/parameter_events
/rosout
```

### 4. Container Status ✅
```
NAME                  STATUS
microros-agent-test   Up (healthy)
robot-bringup-test    Up (healthy)
```

### 5. Dependency Management ✅
- robot-bringup container correctly waits for microros-agent to be healthy
- Startup order is enforced via `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`

### 6. Environment Variables ✅
Verified environment configuration:
- `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0`
- `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp`
- `ROBOT_MODEL_NAME=robot_xl`
- `ROS_LOG_DIR=/tmp/ros_logs` (test mode)

### 7. Volume Mounts ✅
All volume mounts configured correctly:
- `/var/log/robot` - Log persistence
- `/etc/robot` - Configuration (read-only)
- `/var/lib/tailscale` - Tailscale state

## Limitations of Test Environment

### Hardware Devices Not Available
Since this test was performed on macOS without physical robot hardware:
- ❌ `/dev/ttyACM0` (Raspberry Pi Pico) - Not available
- ❌ `/dev/video0` (USB Camera) - Not available
- ❌ Controllers not spawned (requires hardware interface)
- ❌ Topics not publishing data (requires running controllers)

### What Was Tested
✅ Docker image builds and runs correctly
✅ Container orchestration with Docker Compose
✅ Health check mechanisms
✅ Dependency management between services
✅ ROS2 environment setup
✅ Package availability
✅ Volume mount configuration
✅ Environment variable handling

### What Requires Hardware Testing
The following items from the task requirements need to be tested on actual Raspberry Pi hardware:
- Controllers becoming active (requires hardware interface connection)
- Topics publishing data (requires running controllers and sensors)
- micro-ROS agent serial communication
- Camera device access
- Full bringup launch with hardware

## Recommendations

### For Hardware Testing
When testing on actual Raspberry Pi hardware:

1. **Use the production compose file**: `docker/compose.robot-pi.yaml`
2. **Ensure devices are connected**:
   ```bash
   ls -la /dev/ttyACM0  # Raspberry Pi Pico
   ls -la /dev/video0   # USB Camera
   ```
3. **Verify health checks**:
   ```bash
   # Check micro-ROS agent topics
   docker exec microros-agent ros2 topic list | grep joint_states
   
   # Check controllers are active
   docker exec robot-bringup ros2 control list_controllers | grep active
   ```
4. **Monitor logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.robot-pi.yaml logs -f
   ```

### For Production Deployment
1. Create `.env` file from `.env.robot-pi.example`
2. Set `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` if using VPN
3. Verify all volume directories exist with proper permissions
4. Use systemd service for automatic startup (see `docker/robot-docker.service`)

## Conclusion

The Docker Compose configuration has been successfully tested in a development environment. All container orchestration, health checks, and ROS2 environment setup work correctly. The configuration is ready for hardware testing on Raspberry Pi.

### Test Status: ✅ PASSED (with hardware limitations noted)

The test successfully verified:
- ✅ Container startup and orchestration
- ✅ Health check mechanisms
- ✅ ROS2 environment and package availability
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Volume and environment configuration

Hardware-specific testing (controllers, topics, sensors) requires deployment on actual Raspberry Pi with connected devices.
