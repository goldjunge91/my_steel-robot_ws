# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically analyzing and cleaning up the ROS2 robot codebase to remove non-working, duplicate, or obsolete code implementations. The goal is to establish a clean, well-documented, and fully functional codebase where every component has a clear purpose and verified functionality. This cleanup will improve maintainability, reduce confusion, and ensure reliable operation of the my_steel robot platform.

## Requirements
### Requirement 0

**User Story:** As a developer working on the robot platform, I want first check what is actually working and what not.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN before analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all ROS2 packages and their purposes
2. WHEN before analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL categorize each package as: fully functional, partially working, 
3. WHEN before analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL check what is working in simulation.

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the robot platform, I want a comprehensive analysis of all existing code components, so that I can understand what functionality is currently implemented and what state each component is in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify all ROS2 packages and their purposes
2. WHEN analyzing packages THEN the system SHALL categorize each package as: fully functional, partially working, non-functional, or duplicate
3. WHEN duplicate functionality is found THEN the system SHALL document which implementations are redundant and which works better for our stack
4. WHEN analyzing firmware code THEN the system SHALL verify micro-ROS integration status and functionality
5. WHEN reviewing hardware interfaces THEN the system SHALL validate ros2_control integration completeness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove all non-functional or broken code, so that the codebase only contains working implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN non-functional code is identified THEN the system SHALL document the specific issues preventing functionality
2. WHEN broken dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL either fix or remove the affected components
3. WHEN obsolete code is discovered THEN the system SHALL safely remove it without breaking working functionality, if removing will break the functionality its safe to commented out
5. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL update only in small steps to ensure no breaking functionality
4. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL update all related configuration files, and give the user clear instrcution to update the documentation.
6. WHEN code removal is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that remaining functionality still works correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate duplicate implementations into single, well-tested versions, so that maintenance is simplified and functionality is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate implementations are found THEN the system SHALL evaluate which version is most complete and functional
2. WHEN consolidating duplicates THEN the system SHALL preserve the best implementation and remove inferior versions
3. WHEN merging functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure no useful features are lost in the consolidation
4. WHEN duplicate removal is complete THEN the system SHALL update all references to point to the consolidated implementation
5. WHEN consolidation is finished THEN the system SHALL verify that all dependent components still function correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the final codebase structure, so that I can understand what each component does and how they interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide updated architecture documentation
2. WHEN documenting packages THEN the system SHALL clearly describe each package's purpose and functionality
3. WHEN documenting dependencies THEN the system SHALL create a clear dependency map between packages
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure all README files accurately reflect current functionality
5. WHEN documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a migration guide for any breaking changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want verification that the cleaned codebase builds and runs correctly, so that I can be confident the cleanup didn't break essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL successfully build all remaining packages without errors
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL verify that core robot operations (movement, sensors, navigation) work correctly
3. WHEN validating hardware interfaces THEN the system SHALL confirm that ros2_control and micro-ROS communication function properly
4. WHEN testing simulation THEN the system SHALL ensure Gazebo integration remains functional
5. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a test report documenting all validated functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup process to preserve all working functionality while improving code organization, so that no essential features are lost during the cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing functionality THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive inventory of all working features
2. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL ensure no working functionality is accidentally deleted
3. WHEN reorganizing code THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL preserve all working parameter settings
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL demonstrate that all previously working features remain functional
