# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to clean up the ROS2 robot codebase by analyzing, categorizing, and consolidating packages to eliminate non-functional, duplicate, or obsolete code. The cleanup will result in a streamlined, well-documented, and fully functional codebase that supports the my_steel robot's core functionality: omnidirectional movement, autonomous navigation, and interactive Nerf launcher capabilities.

Based on the analysis of existing workspace analysis files and the current repository structure, several issues have been identified:
- Legacy packages needing restructuring (robot package is old implementation, needs reorganization)
- Experimental packages to be archived (mecabridge_hardware was experimental attempt, robot_hardware_interfaces is the active development)
- Empty or minimal packages (robot_gazebo, robot_firmware, robot_autonomy)
- Missing dependencies causing build failures
- Hardware functionality scattered across multiple packages (DC motors, servos, ESCs need proper organization)

## Architecture

### Cleanup Strategy Architecture

The cleanup process follows a four-phase architecture:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Systematic evaluation of all packages and their current state
2. **Categorization Phase**: Classification of packages into functional, non-functional, duplicate, or obsolete
3. **Consolidation Phase**: Merging duplicate functionality and removing broken code
4. **Validation Phase**: Testing and documentation updates

### Target Package Architecture

After cleanup, the codebase will follow this streamlined architecture:

```
Core Packages (Essential):
├── robot_description/        # URDF/XACRO models, meshes, configurations
├── robot_bringup/           # Launch files and system orchestration  
├── robot_hardware_interfaces/ # Active hardware interface development (DC motors, servos, ESCs)
├── robot_controllers/       # Controller configurations
└── robot_utils/             # Development tools and utilities

Functionality Packages (Feature-specific):
├── robot_gazebo/            # Simulation assets (if functional)
├── robot_localization/      # Sensor fusion and EKF
├── robot_vision/            # Computer vision nodes (includes Nerf launcher targeting)
├── robot_nerf_launcher/     # Nerf launcher hardware control (may integrate with robot_hardware_interfaces)
├── robot_autonomy/          # Navigation and autonomous behaviors
└── robot_firmware/          # Pico firmware (if separate from hardware)

Restructured Legacy Package:
├── robot/                   # Reorganized structure with repo collections:
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── package.xml
│   ├── manipulator.repos
│   ├── nerf_launcher.repos  # (unclear - needs clarification)
│   ├── robot_hardware.repos
│   └── robot_simulation.repos

External Dependencies:
├── open_manipulator_x/      # Third-party manipulator (evaluate necessity)
└── robot-micro-ROS-Agent/   # micro-ROS communication bridge (real hardware only)

Archived/Experimental:
└── mecabridge_hardware/     # Experimental attempt - archive for reference
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Package Analysis Component

**Purpose**: Systematically analyze each package to determine its current state and functionality.

**Interface**:
- Input: Package directories, build logs, dependency information
- Output: Package status report (functional/non-functional/duplicate/obsolete)

**Implementation**:
- Parse package.xml files for dependencies and metadata
- Attempt builds to identify compilation issues
- Check for actual implementation vs empty packages
- Analyze launch files and configuration completeness

### Duplicate Detection Component

**Purpose**: Identify packages with overlapping or duplicate functionality.

**Interface**:
- Input: Package analysis results, source code analysis
- Output: Duplicate functionality mapping

**Package Status Clarifications**:
1. **robot package**: Legacy implementation (first attempt) - needs restructuring into repo collection format
2. **mecabridge_hardware**: Experimental attempt - archive for reference, continue with robot_hardware_interfaces
3. **robot_hardware_interfaces**: Active development - expand to include DC motors, servos, ESCs functionality
4. **robot_controller vs robot_controllers**: Similar naming, potentially overlapping functionality

**Architecture Decisions Needed**:
- **robot package restructuring**: Transform into repo collection structure with:
  - manipulator.repos
  - nerf_launcher.repos (unclear purpose - needs clarification)
  - robot_hardware.repos
  - robot_simulation.repos
- **Hardware functionality distribution**: DC motors, servos, ESCs control needs to be properly organized between robot_hardware_interfaces and other packages
- **robot_nerf_launcher placement**: Determine integration with robot_hardware_interfaces or keep separate
- **robot-micro-ROS-Agent**: Clarified as real hardware communication only, not for simulation

### Consolidation Engine

**Purpose**: Merge duplicate implementations while preserving the best functionality.

**Interface**:
- Input: Duplicate mappings, functionality assessments
- Output: Consolidated package structure

**Consolidation Rules**:
- Archive experimental packages (mecabridge_hardware) for reference
- Continue development with active packages (robot_hardware_interfaces)
- Restructure legacy packages (robot) into proper repo collection format
- Maintain standard ROS2 naming conventions
- Preserve working launch files and configurations
- Properly organize hardware functionality (DC motors, servos, ESCs) across appropriate packages

### Validation Framework

**Purpose**: Ensure cleanup doesn't break essential functionality.

**Interface**:
- Input: Cleaned codebase
- Output: Validation report with test results

**Validation Tests**:
- Build all remaining packages successfully
- Launch core robot functionality
- Verify hardware interface connectivity
- Test simulation capabilities (if retained)

## Data Models

### Package Status Model

```yaml
PackageStatus:
  name: string
  path: string
  status: enum [FUNCTIONAL, PARTIAL, BROKEN, EMPTY, DUPLICATE]
  build_success: boolean
  dependencies_met: boolean
  has_implementation: boolean
  duplicate_of: string (optional)
  issues: list[string]
  recommendation: enum [KEEP, REMOVE, MERGE, FIX]
```

### Consolidation Plan Model

```yaml
ConsolidationPlan:
  target_package: string
  source_packages: list[string]
  actions:
    - type: enum [MERGE, MOVE, DELETE, RENAME]
      source: string
      target: string
      files: list[string]
  breaking_changes: list[string]
  migration_notes: string
```

## Error Handling

### Build Failure Recovery

**Strategy**: When packages fail to build due to missing dependencies:
1. Attempt to resolve dependencies through rosdep
2. If dependencies are from other workspace packages, build in correct order
3. If dependencies are missing/obsolete, mark package for removal or fixing
4. Document all unresolvable dependencies

### Data Loss Prevention

**Strategy**: Before any destructive operations:
1. Create backup branches in all affected repositories
2. Document all changes in migration logs
3. Preserve original functionality in consolidated packages
4. Maintain rollback capability throughout process

### Dependency Chain Breaks

**Strategy**: When removing packages that others depend on:
1. Update all dependent packages to use consolidated alternatives
2. Update launch files and configuration references
3. Provide clear migration documentation
4. Test all dependent functionality after changes

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Cleanup Testing

1. **Baseline Functionality Test**: Document current working features
2. **Build Status Assessment**: Identify which packages currently build successfully
3. **Integration Test**: Test end-to-end robot functionality where possible

### During Cleanup Testing

1. **Incremental Build Testing**: Test builds after each consolidation step
2. **Dependency Validation**: Ensure no circular or broken dependencies
3. **Configuration Consistency**: Verify all references are updated correctly

### Post-Cleanup Testing

1. **Complete Build Test**: All remaining packages must build without errors
2. **Functionality Verification**: Core robot operations must work
3. **Simulation Test**: Gazebo integration (if retained) must function
4. **Hardware Interface Test**: ros2_control and micro-ROS communication validation

### Test Automation

```bash
# Automated test script structure
./test_cleanup.sh
├── test_build_all.sh          # Build all packages
├── test_dependencies.sh       # Check dependency resolution
├── test_launch_files.sh       # Validate launch file syntax
├── test_hardware_interface.sh # Test hardware connectivity
└── test_simulation.sh         # Test Gazebo functionality
```
