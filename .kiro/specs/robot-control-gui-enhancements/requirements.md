# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for enhancing the existing Robot Control GUI with advanced ROS2 command capabilities, intelligent error recovery, comprehensive process monitoring, and automatic launch configuration discovery. The existing GUI currently provides basic functionality through six main tabs (Dashboard, Teleoperation, Robot Control, Simulation, Firmware, Monitoring) with core modules for configuration management, process control, and ROS2 interface. These enhancements will extend the current architecture to provide professional-grade robotics development tools while maintaining the existing user experience and workflow.

4. WHEN monitoring active processes THEN the system SHALL update resource statistics every 2 seconds with historical trend graphs showing the last 60 data points for performance analysis
5. WHEN viewing process relationships THEN the system SHALL display hierarchical parent-child process trees with expandable views and dependency visualization
6. WHEN processes become problematic THEN the system SHALL automatically detect zombie processes, memory leaks, high CPU usage, and unresponsive states with visual warning indicators
7. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic report generation including process states, resource usage patterns, system logs, and performance metrics
8. WHEN background operations run THEN the system SHALL track and display worker thread status, execution time, error states, and resource consumption for all GUI operations

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Launch Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a robot developer, I want automated discovery and intelligent management of ROS2 launch configurations integrated with the existing workspace structure, so that I can efficiently test different robot setups and manage complex launch scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL implement workspace scanning to recursively discover launch files (.launch.py, .launch.xml, .launch) and index them by package with caching for performance
2. WHEN launch files are discovered THEN the system SHALL parse them using intelligent parsers to extract parameters, types, default values, descriptions, and dependency information
3. WHEN the user selects a launch configuration THEN the system SHALL generate dynamic parameter forms with appropriate input widgets (text fields, number spinners, checkboxes, dropdown menus) based on parameter types
4. WHEN the user modifies launch parameters THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation with immediate feedback, constraint checking, and error highlighting
5. WHEN the user executes launch configurations THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing ProcessManager to launch with specified parameters and provide real-time node monitoring
